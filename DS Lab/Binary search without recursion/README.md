#AIM:To write a program to search an element in an array by using binary search without recursive method.

##DESCRIPTION:Ifn a non recursive binary search ,if the val argument is not initially found in the array using the pointers ,we can eliminate half of the possibilities by checking whether the middle array element is bigger or smaller than the given val argument.Array needs to be sorted.
