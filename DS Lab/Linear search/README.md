#AIM:
To write a program using recursive functions that perform the linear search operations for a key value in a given list of integers.

##EXPLANATION:
The linearsearch using recursion method works backwards from the end of the array to the start.Both linear search solutions return the same value and posses the same Big O time complexity of O(n).

###STEP BY STEP PROCEDURE:
